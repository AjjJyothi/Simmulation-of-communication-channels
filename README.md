# Simmulation-of-communication-channels
Nowadays Simulation plays a key role due to it's ease to effectively evaluate the performance of a communication system. While simulating we have to generate symbols at the input. Generating symbols manually is a difficult task. So we use random number generation techniques to generate them.We worked on implementing matlab code for Inverse laplace transform and inverse transform sampling . Using  random numbers bit error rates of MRC, MIMO, OFDM, OFDM with MRC, MIMO are simulated and verified with theoritical expressions.
